# Chat Damage Buttons (5e)

This module replaces the right-click context menu with buttons on the dice-roll chat message. 
- I believe the workflow for applying damage to tokens is smoother with buttons compared to the right-click context menu method.
- There is a bug with the right-click context menu currently when using the bottom most chat-message. This approach provides a work around for this issue.

Current Issues:
- styling is sub-optimal
- the dice-tooltip event is also triggered when a button is clicked

Shoutout to Felix#6196 for the Spell-Browser module I used as an example of how to use hooks and modify the HTML appropirately.
