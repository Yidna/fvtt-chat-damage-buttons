# Simple Chat Damage Buttons (5e)

A fork of [Chat Damage Buttons by Hooking](https://gitlab.com/hooking/foundry-vtt---chat-damage-buttons/-/tree/master).

The old project was out of date and didn't work with v0.7.9 of FoundryVTT.


This module replaces the right-click context menu with buttons on the dice-roll chat message.
